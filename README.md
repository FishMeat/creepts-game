# Creepts - a Cartesi Game based on Anuto TD

A JS and Cartesi-compatible implementation of Anuto TD coded in TypeScript and using the game engine Phaser V3

## Development

- `npm run dev`: runs webpack-dev-server for the game development only (phaser);
- `npm run dev:cartesi`: runs webpack-dev-server including the React UI for Cartesi tournaments. You must have `backend` running locally;
- `npm run build`: build production assets at `dist/`
- `npm run build:game`: build production assets at `dist/` without React UI for Cartesi tournaments.
- `npm run build:app`: build only the `app` target at `dist/`
